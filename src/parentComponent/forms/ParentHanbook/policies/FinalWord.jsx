        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Our primary concern is for the safety and welfare of the children attending The Goddard School® in Lynnwood, 
          WA. Our Emergency Operations Plan provides for response to all types of emergencies. Depending on the 
          circumstances of the emergency, we will use one of the following protective actions:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="space-y-4 text-md leading-relaxed mb-8 ml-4">
          <li className="flex">
            <span className="mr-2">•</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Immediate evacuation:</strong> Students are evacuated to a safe area on the grounds of the facility in the event of 
              a fire, etc.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li className="flex">
            <span className="mr-2">•</span>
            <div>
              <strong>In-place sheltering:</strong> Sudden occurrences may dictate that taking cover inside the building is the best 
              immediate response.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li className="flex">
            <span className="mr-2">•</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Evacuation:</strong> In certain emergency situations, total evacuation of the facility may become necessary. In this 
              case, the children will be taken to a safe relocation facility. Parents will be contacted by telephone as to 
              the location of the children, or by radio broadcast if phone transmission is not possible.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li className="flex">
            <span className="mr-2">•</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Modified Operation:</strong> This may include cancellation, postponement, or rescheduling of normal activities. 
              These actions are normally taken in the event of a winter storm or facility problems that make it unsafe 
              for students (such as utility disruptions). However, this action may be necessary in a variety of situations.
            </div>

        </ul>
        
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-8">
          In the event of a local or regional emergency, please tune into your local news and radio stations for updated 
          announcements. You may also go to goddardschool.com and click on the Lynnwood, WA location for 
          announcements relating to any of the emergency actions listed above.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-8">
          We ask that you do not call the school during an emergency. This will keep the main telephone line free to make 
          emergency calls and relay information. We will call you and let you know that we've taken one of these protective 
          actions. We will also call you when we have resolved the situation, and it is safe for you to pick up your child(ren).
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-8">
          The Owner and/or Directors may provide an alternative phone number (i.e. cell phone number) to call in the event 
          of an emergency via group email or posting on our school's website.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Our emergency preparedness plan is reviewed on a semi-annual basis with all staff and is located in each classroom 
          binder as well as in the Director and Owner offices.
